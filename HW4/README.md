This is the 'Heap Sorting program in C' on my resume. The zip file contains the final contents of my heap sorting program. 
'heap.c' will contain the functions, 'heap.h' is the header file containing the function names and their parameters,  while 'run_test.c' will contain the contents that will take take in a
  test file from the user (the text files) and use the functions created in 'heap.c'
